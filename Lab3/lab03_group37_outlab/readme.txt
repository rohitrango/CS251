Reflection Essay -

The outlab was very interesting (and tough) at the same time. Out of all the labs till now, BASH scripting covered a wide range of topics for us. Lesser examples and more formal documentation made us sit and read the manual patiently. On the other hand, this assignment was like a real game. In fact, Rohit is a Pokemon fan, and all of us could not wait to complete the assignment. We were a little disappointed by the number of magikarps we got :P , but the last task of using a dictionary attack felt like actually catching a legendary pokemon. We learnt a wide range of things from this assignment. BASH is definitely a fun (and hard) thing to learn, and we can definitely use Bash in a very powerful way. This was probably the lab that made us feel like novice 'Code Warriors' now.
